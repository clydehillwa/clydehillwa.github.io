## Clyde Hill Budget, Part TK: Revenue

_A breakdown of actual revenue will help here._

Because Clyde Hill is almost entirely residential, the tax base is uneven and different from a typical city. 

**Clyde Hill’s revenue depends heavily on sales tax on construction activity in the city.**

Typically for Clyde Hill, this is residential redevelopment; we share in the sales tax on materials being delivered to the site. Clyde Hill also collects permit fees. Revenue from these sources is not restricted in its use. We recently finished several years of exceptional revenue from the redevelopment of the two public schools (Chinook Middle School, Clyde Hill Elementary) here. Development revenue is cyclical because development activities are. (“If a property changes hands, the City receives a third type of revenue, Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) that is restricted in its use, primarily toward capital needs.”)

Another source of sales tax revenue is products and services delivered to residents (assuming they record their address as Clyde Hill and not Bellevue). “The City has almost no commercial retail base to augment the sales tax received.”

Property taxes, while stable, provide ~26% of the General Fund's revenue, down from 31% ten years ago. “One of the problematic conditions facing local governments is that property taxes, while stable, rise more slowly than expenditures.” 

The other sources of revenue are relatively minor: “facility leases for wireless communication, utility and franchise fees, and police and other services provided to other communities.”

“The City’s ability to increase or grow this revenue from any or all of these sources is limited by statute, practicality and fairness.”
Worth noting that until last year, Clyde Hill had “not taken the allowed 1% growth in property taxes for 10 years and not taken the allowed new construction component since 2016.”
