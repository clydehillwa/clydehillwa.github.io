# Getting Started
_NOTE: this site is [about exploring the workings of a city](about.html) and not the official [city government site](https://clydehill.org). We welcome corrections and suggestions._



First, some background on the city.

### Origin story: Land use 
Clyde Hill has about [3300](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/clyde-hill-wa) people in about [1100](https://www.clydehill.org/about-clyde-hill/general-information/) households. The Wikipedia article covers the why of Clyde Hill well:

>“In response to the community's desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City.”

The City's minimum lot size is just shy of a half-acre (20,000 square feet); as Wikipedia says “smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City.”

Summarizing the relevant bits of the rest of the article for the discussion here: 

Clyde Hill is zoned almost entirely for residential single-family use with a few exceptions: 
- two commercial properties: a gas station and [coffee shop](https://www.queenbeecafe.com);
- a small government zone: city hall, police and fire stations, public works, and a public tennis court;
- two public schools: [Clyde Hill Elementary](https://bsd405.org/clydehill/) and [Chinook Middle School](https://bsd405.org/chinook/); and 
- two private ones: [Bellevue Christian School](https://www.bellevuechristian.org) and [Sacred Heart School (including Sacred Heart Parish)](https://www.sacredheart.org). 

### City Government

The residents of Clyde Hill elect a Mayor and five City Council members. The Mayor hires a full-time professional city administrator to serve under them with responsibilty for administrative and other duties (ex budget preparation, people management, etc.). 

The formal term here is a _Hybrid City Administrator System_. Clyde Hill is a _Mayor-Council_ city with "a mayor elected at-large, who serves as the city's chief administrative officer, and a separately elected council (elected either at-large or from districts) which serves as the municipality's legislative body. This separation of powers is based on the traditional federal and state models in the United States." [link](https://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Legal/General-Government/City-and-Town-Forms-of-Government.aspx) A bit more detail: "The council has the authority to formulate and adopt city policies and the mayor is responsible for carrying them out. The mayor attends and presides over council meetings but does not vote, except in the case of a tie." Also, "In all but the largest cities, elected mayors and councilmembers serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to administrative personnel."

(Sidenote: the City of Medina, next door, has the _Council-Manager Form_: the residents elect  "a city council (which may be elected at-large or from districts) which is responsible for policymaking, and [there is] a professional city manager, appointed by the council, who is responsible for administration." In this form, "a ceremonial mayor presides at council meetings and is recognized as the head of the city for ceremonial purposes but has no regular administrative duties.")

This is separate from Clyde Hill's status as a _non-charter code_ city (mentioned above). Also, "All cities in King County are “non-charter code” cities, except the city of Seattle and the towns of Beaux Arts Village, Hunts Point, Skykomish and Yarrow Point.” ([King County 2021 Candidate Manual, p.13](https://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/elections/for-candidates/pdfs/candidate-manual.ashx?la=en)).

As Clyde Hill is in King County, [King County](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/about-us.aspx) conducts elections for the City Council positions and Mayor. "The Clyde Hill City Council are elected at large to staggered four-year terms," ([ClydeHill.org](https://www.clydehill.org/government/council)) with three seats up for election in 2021 and the other two in 2023. The Mayor's term is also four years.
