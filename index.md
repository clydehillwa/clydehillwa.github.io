### Practical Civics 
June 26, 2021

I wanted to understand, more practically than theoretically, _how_ local government _works_ (structure, function, rhythm), especially the interaction between elected officials, government employees, code, and the people who actually live here. 

The goal with this site is to distill and set out, in an easy to understand way, that understanding. As I read, ask questions, and talk with friends, I want to capture the model of 'modern local civics of a small US city' that emerges.

Writing in this format is a forcing function for clarity and structure than typically doesn't happen in Notes to Oneself. 

I welcome corrections, suggestions, and feedback. This is for sure a work in progress. 

_NOTE: this site is about [exploring how the city works](about.html) and is **not** the [official city government site](https://clydehill.org)._
