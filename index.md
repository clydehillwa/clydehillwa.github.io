# Overview
NOTE: this site is [about this](about.html) and not the official [city government site](https://clydehill.org).

Clyde Hill has about 3300 people in about 1000 households. The Wikipedia article covers it well:

>“In response to the community's desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City.”

Summarizing the relevant bits for the discussion here: 

Clyde Hill is zoned almost entirely for residential single-family use with a few exceptions: 
- two commercial properties: a gas station and [coffee shop](https://www.queenbeecafe.com);
- a small government zone: city hall, police and fire stations, public works, and a public tennis court;
- two public schools: [Clyde Hill Elementary](https://bsd405.org/clydehill/) and [Chinook Middle School](https://bsd405.org/chinook/); and 
- two private ones: [Bellevue Christian School](https://www.bellevuechristian.org) and [Sacred Heart School (including Sacred Heart Parish)](https://www.sacredheart.org). 

The City's minimum lot size is just shy of a half-acre (20,000 square feet); as Wikipedia says “smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City.”
