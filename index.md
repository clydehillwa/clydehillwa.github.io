### Practical Civics 
_This page last updated July 2, 2021; Started June 26, 2021_


I wanted to understand, more practically than theoretically, _how_ local government _works_ (structure, function, rhythm), especially the interaction between elected officials, government employees, code, and the people who actually live here. The point of view is from someone who just lives here, with no professional experience in law, governance, or civil service. 

The goal with this site is to distill and set out, in an easy to understand way, that understanding. As I read, ask questions, and talk with friends, I want to capture the model of 'modern local civics of a small US city' that emerges. Writing in this format is a forcing function for clarity and structure that typically does not happen in Notes to Oneself. The sections are emerging organically based on conversations and feedback on drafts. 

The notes here are a work in progress [exploring how the city works](about.html) and is **not** the [official city government site](https://clydehill.org). The information contained in this site is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be construed as legal advice on any subject matter. You should not act or refrain from acting on the basis of any content included in this site without seeking legal or other professional advice. 

I welcome corrections, suggestions, and feedback. This is for sure a work in progress.
