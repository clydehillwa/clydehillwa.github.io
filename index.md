# About this site...

A year or two ago, I got curious about the _practice_ of civics: what's the de facto reality of how we get along in society. Reading the _theory_ is always fun... and I live somewhere _real_, not theoretical, with a budget, police force, public works department, mayor, etc. 

How does it, well, _work_?

I figured let's start local. I started paying more attention to local government in the city where I live. I’ve been attending public meetings, reading the briefing packets… I even sat in on the budget process.

It's all public. It's not always accessible, or well-documented, or easy to make sense of. That bothered me. 

My goal with this site is to pull stuff I learned and ran across in the process of going to the meetings and asking questions out of my notes and out on the web. As I talked with friends about what I was running across, this seemed like a good idea. 

So, here goes.
