### City Government: Form

The residents of Clyde Hill elect a Mayor and five City Council members. The Mayor hires a full-time professional City Administrator to administrate. The city manager serves under the Mayor. 

Clyde Hill is a _Mayor-Council_ city: "a mayor elected at-large, who serves as the city's chief administrative officer, and a separately elected council (elected either at-large or from districts) which serves as the municipality's legislative body." This description is from one of [The Municipal Research and Services Center (MRSC)](https://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Legal/General-Government/City-and-Town-Forms-of-Government.aspx)'s great write-ups. "This separation of powers is based on the traditional federal and state models in the United States:"

> The council has the authority to formulate and adopt city policies and the mayor is responsible for carrying them out.... In all but the largest cities, elected mayors and councilmembers serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to administrative personnel.

The [Mayor & Councilmember handbook](https://mrsc.org/getmedia/034f13b6-7ec2-4594-b60b-efaf61dd7d10/Mayor-And-Councilmember-Handbook.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf) goes on to say:

>In general, mayors should remember that the council meeting is just that – it’s the council’s meeting, not the mayor’s meeting. The council sets its own rules and has ultimate control over the agenda. The mayor’s role is to chair the meeting.

Sidenote: the City of Medina, next door, has the _Council-Manager Form_: the residents elect  "a city council (which may be elected at-large or from districts) which is responsible for policymaking, and [there is] a professional city manager, appointed by the council, who is responsible for administration." In this form, "a ceremonial mayor presides at council meetings and is recognized as the head of the city for ceremonial purposes but has no regular administrative duties.")

This is separate from Clyde Hill's status as a _non-charter code_ city. Turns out that "All cities in King County are “non-charter code” cities, except the city of Seattle and the towns of Beaux Arts Village, Hunts Point, Skykomish and Yarrow Point.” ([King County 2021 Candidate Manual, p.13](https://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/elections/for-candidates/pdfs/candidate-manual.ashx?la=en)). Best as I can tell, a city can [adopt a charter](https://mrsc.org/Home/Explore-Topics/Legal/General-Government/City-and-Town-Forms-of-Government.aspx#charters) in order to set up a different set of rules for its governance. For example, here is a link to [Seattle's charter](https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=THCHSE). 




[King County](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/about-us.aspx) conducts elections for the City Council positions and Mayor. "The Clyde Hill City Council are elected at large to staggered four-year terms," ([ClydeHill.org](https://www.clydehill.org/government/council)) with three seats up for election in 2021 and the other two in 2023. The Mayor's term is also four years.
