### Origin story: Land use 
Clyde Hill has about [3300](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/clyde-hill-wa) people in about [1100](https://www.clydehill.org/about-clyde-hill/general-information/) households. The Wikipedia article covers the why of Clyde Hill well:

>“In response to the community's desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City.”

The City's minimum lot size is just shy of a half-acre (20,000 square feet); as Wikipedia says “smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City.”

Summarizing the relevant bits of the rest of the article for the discussion here: 

Clyde Hill is zoned almost entirely for residential single-family use with a few exceptions: 
- two commercial properties: a gas station and [coffee shop](https://www.queenbeecafe.com);
- a small government zone: city hall, police and fire stations, public works, and a public tennis court;
- two public schools: [Clyde Hill Elementary](https://bsd405.org/clydehill/) and [Chinook Middle School](https://bsd405.org/chinook/); and 
- two private ones: [Bellevue Christian School](https://www.bellevuechristian.org) and [Sacred Heart School (including Sacred Heart Parish)](https://www.sacredheart.org).
