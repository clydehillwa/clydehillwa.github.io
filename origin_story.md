### Origin story: Land use development
The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Hill,_Washington) covers the why of Clyde Hill well:

>In response to the community's desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City.

The city is almost entirely residential single-family homes. That is, it is _zoned_ for single-family use with the exception of a few local government buildings, schools, a gas station and a coffee shop. Specifically:

- a small government zone: city hall, police and fire stations, public works, and a public tennis court;
- two public schools: [Clyde Hill Elementary](https://bsd405.org/clydehill/) and [Chinook Middle School](https://bsd405.org/chinook/); and 
- two private ones: [Bellevue Christian School](https://www.bellevuechristian.org) and [Sacred Heart School (including Sacred Heart Parish)](https://www.sacredheart.org). 
- two commercial properties: a gas station and [coffee shop](https://www.queenbeecafe.com);


The minimum lot size is just shy of a half-acre (20,000 square feet); as Wikipedia says “smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City”).

Clyde Hill is almost entirely developed and there is no room to expand into neighboring Bellevue, Kirkland, Medina, Yarrow Point, or Hunts Point. 

Every city has local goals and concerns. On its website, Clyde Hill sets out its focus clearly:

>Today the philosophy of the City is to retain and maintain the original spacious and wooded character of the community and to remain a relatively small, simple and intimate community. The amenities, the quality residential areas, the parks, the views and natural landscape are all items the community intends to maintain....  It is intended that further development will be consistent and harmonious within the established pattern. Therefore, the current land use pattern and general densities will likely remain unchanged in the foreseeable future.

Clyde Hill's population is about [3300](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/clyde-hill-wa) people distributed across about [1100](https://www.clydehill.org/about-clyde-hill/general-information/) households, occupying about a square mile in total.
