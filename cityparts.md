### City Government: Parts

Echoing federal and state government, local city government has executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

The mayor appoints the City Administrator who “oversee[s] the daily operation of all departments and personnel of the City” and “is responsible for ensuring that the policy set by the City Council is carried out in a professional, efficient, cost effective and timely manner.” [City of Clyde Hill](https://www.clydehill.org/departments/city-hall/administrator-and-clerk/)

Legislative matters in Clyde Hill are the responsibility of the City Council: “Council members have the primary responsibility to establish the policy, direction and goals for the City. The governing laws of the City are developed and adopted by the City Council through specific ordinances… [and] are embodied in the Clyde Hill Municipal Code.” [City of Clyde Hill](https://www.clydehill.org/government/council)

From vote411.org (July 2021)
> The City Council is the legislative body for the City. The Council adopts local laws (ordinances) to secure the safety and assist the well-being of the city residents, the city's physical environment and amenities, and the city economy. The Council is responsible for approving financial expenditures and adopting the city budget as well as establishing policies and regulations in order to guide the city's future. The elected mayor serves as chief administrative officer for the city.
