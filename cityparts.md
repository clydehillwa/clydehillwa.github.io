### City Government: Parts

Echoing federal and state government, local city government has executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

Judicial matters in Clyde Hill go to Kirkland: “Clyde Hill Municipal Court services are provided by Kirkland Municipal Court under an interlocal agreement.” [link](https://www.courtreference.com/courts/24408/clyde-hill-municipal-court)

Executive matters in Clyde Hill are the responsibility of the mayor. The mayor appoints the City Administrator who “oversee[s] the daily operation of all departments and personnel of the City” and “is responsible for ensuring that the policy set by the City Council is carried out in a professional, efficient, cost effective and timely manner.” [City of Clyde Hill](https://www.clydehill.org/departments/city-hall/administrator-and-clerk/)

Legislative matters in Clyde Hill are the responsibility of the City Council: “Council members have the primary responsibility to establish the policy, direction and goals for the City. The governing laws of the City are developed and adopted by the City Council through specific ordinances… [and] are embodied in the Clyde Hill Municipal Code.” [City of Clyde Hill](https://www.clydehill.org/government/council)
