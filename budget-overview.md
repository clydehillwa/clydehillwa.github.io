## Clyde Hill Budget, Part TK: Overview

The _services_ that Clyde Hill provides cost a lot of money, which comes from a few different _revenue sources_. Because this is a _public, government_ entity, there are regulations and subtleties that differ from personal and commercial budgets and finance around almost everything, from the _process_ to _operating restrictions_ – typically for good reasons, like avoiding fraud. In this section, I want to play back my understanding to make making sense of this process easier. 

As MRSC's [Revenue Guide for Washington Cities and Towns](https://mrsc.org/getmedia/d3f7f211-fc63-4b7a-b362-cb17993d5fe5/Revenue-Guide-For-Washington-Cities-And-Towns.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf) says,

>The foundation of any city government is its fiscal health. The revenues it receives, both present and projected for the future, set the stage for discussing what services to provide as well as the level of those services – including the facilities, equipment, and infrastructure that will be needed.

(That document goes on to discuss taxes (property, sales and use, lodging taxes (hotel/motel tax), real estate excise taxes (REET), other excise taxes as well as business and utility taxes & fees, “State-shared” revenues, other revenue sources, and special taxing districts.)
