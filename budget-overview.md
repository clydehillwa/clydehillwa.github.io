## Clyde Hill Budget, Part TK: Overview

The _services_ that Clyde Hill provides cost a lot of money, which comes from a few different _revenue sources_. Because this is a _public, government_ entity, there are regulations and subtleties that differ from personal and commercial budgets and finance around almost everything, from the _process_ to _operating restrictions_ â€“ typically for good reasons, like avoiding fraud. In this section, I want to play back my understanding to make making sense of this process easier. 

### Services

CH provides "essential governmental services to its citizens, including police, fire, public works and streets, building, code enforcement, storm water management and adjunct and related services."

### Revenue
TK. Separate section right now

### Process

Quotes here:
> The goal of the 2021 Budget process is to deliver to Clyde Hill citizens a balanced budget that maintains the current level of essential services that are expected. 

> The budget being presented is a good faith effort at balancing the needs of the citizens for essential services with being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
 
> A further requirement is that the City staff deliver good value and provide responsible stewardship of the taxpayer resources entrusted to our care. 

>The City of Clyde Hill has a core value of being fiscally responsible in its budget polices and fiscal practices. It is through these policies and practices that the City has been able to maintain essential governmental services at levels that are expected by our residents while at the same time building our reserves.
