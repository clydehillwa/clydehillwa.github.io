## About that house

The city owns the house next door (east) of the fire department building at [9629 NE 24th St](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=8086000370). Clyde Hill bought the property in 1995 for ~$165K; Redfin estimates its value at $1.5m in 2021. 

Clyde Hill joined [ARCH](https://www.archhousing.org) ("A Regional Coalition for Housing -- Working together to house East King County") in 1999. (Some of the documents [here](assets/ch_arch.pdf)). ARCH's mission is "preserve and increase the supply of housing for low and moderate income households in East King County"

The city established a “Housing Rental Department” in 1995.

The following is an excerpt from our “2021  Staff Final Budget Overview.”  
 
> **Housing Rental Department**
> 
> The Housing Rental Department was established in 1995 to keep track of the finances related to the home next to the fire station. After using the home as a temporary City Hall, the City began to rent the home and receives credit from ARCH (A Regional Coalition of Housing) for providing lower income housing. The budget proposes to rent the 800 square foot home next year for $950/month, less leasehold taxes paid to the State. A $4k expenditure is budgeted to cover unforeseen repairs and maintenance.
 
> An account in the department is used to track the City’s pledge to ARCH to provide affordable housing on the Eastside. An appropriation of $22,300 is budgeted for 2021 that would authorize funding towards affordable housing on the Eastside on a future ARCH Trust Fund project. The need for additional affordable housing has outpaced ARCH’s funding.

> That house is OLD and on its last legs. We were not planning on re-renting it again as it is due to be demolished as part of the Fire Station 5 replacement project. That project has been delayed so we saw the opportunity to help some folks out with some affordable housing while they get themselves back on their feet as well as subsidizes our annual contributions to the ARCH program. Once the rental house revenue goes away we lose most of the money we have been paying them. 
 
> Past practice had been that we have raised the rent $10 each year. The new renters are now paying $970 a month, plus utilities. I assume they created the Housing department budget at the time the house was acquired by the City.

> 
> An application and lease agreement is being finalized with a new family/tenant for the next year. The house has been vacant for the past few months but has recently been prepared by Tyler for occupancy again. Once leased, this will provide a large portion of the transfer to ARCH with respect to the City’s allocation to the Trust Fund.
